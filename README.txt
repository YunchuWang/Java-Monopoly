WELCOME TO JAVA-MONOPOLY

Before You Begin:
-our implementation of monopoly is a simpler spin on the classic bord game. 
-To get started, since this program is an interconnected web of references, Emacs and running from the command line is quite impossible. 
-The best way to run this program is to use an IDE such as Eclipse that con compile multiple class without referencing errors. 
-Also note that even though our board has potential to have houses hotels and implement motgagaes, we chose not to do this for simplicity. 
	We wanted to show that we undestood how to make this game by implementing the different data structures without getting carried away
	with complex details that might confuse us. 
	
As you play:
- To start/reset the game you have to press the New Game Button. 
- Although you might be prompted otherwise, Buying a property, Paying rent, and  Drawing a card all require the user to click the button. 
	They are not automatically done for you. This was done in order to keep the players engagaed in the events of the game. 
- Please note that you can click on any property on the board at any time to get its name, price, rent, and name of owner.
