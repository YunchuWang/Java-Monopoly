GENERAL IDEA


REPLICATING AN EXISTING GAME?

(If so, explain game mechanics and your added funcionality.)
Yes. Monopoly.
Will include: game board, players + banker (counters for $, etc), 2 dice (RNG), the Chance/Community cards for when landing on specific tiles, property (rent? mortgage? sell/buy, keeping track of who owns what and where it is).

INCORPORATION OF APCS TOPICS
( Give explanation of how you will make use of topics learned in this course in your project...)
well, making new classes to use obviously uh
-using awt/sheels/some form of pictures
-swing
-interfaces
-Queues to make the chance and Community chest decks & Queue of Players
-Arrays to make the board
-ArrayList to make a lot of stuff
-Extending classes to subclasses



PROOF OF PRINCIPLE
(You should perform some basic tests to ensure your idea is workable. What are these tests and will you be performing them? ...or you already performed them; how did they turn out?)
- printing out the board (yes, we will be doing this)
- moving on the board -> updating it after each move

MAJOR COMPONENTS
-game board: each tile has some kind of action the player must act out if it lands on that space.
-graphics. board design? players? dice?
-bank, property systems (how does the property system work - is there rent? etc)

DIVISION OF LABOR / TASK DELEGATION

(Possibly related to Major Components section. Can each major component be handled by a single team member? Etc...)
-learning to use awt should be for everyone.
- Timo -> the GUI stuff
- Cassandra -> cards, decks, players, 
- Bianca -> txt files manager

Everyone-> underlying implementation of the game, board, location, property, etc


ROUGH TIMELINE
- create Locations, Properties, Railroads, etc b/c they ,make up the board
- make the board -> Array of Locations
- make the Cards 
- make the chance & Community Chest -> Queue of Cards
- make player
- make the graphics
