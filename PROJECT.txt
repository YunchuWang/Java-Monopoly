1. What went wrong?
(i.e., How did you find yourself unable to submit work you were satisfied with? Poor scheduling? Good schedule, but lack of adherence to it? Explain.
Unexpected obstacles? If so, what were they, etc. Explain. 
Group member problems? 
Communication issues? 
Technical difficulties?
etc, etc, etc.  
Whatever the deal was, explain.)
Our problem with the work was that there was a lot of it to do, and we underestimated the time it would take to do it. TIme flies by, and it is very easy to find yourself reaching a deadline and still have work that you aren't satisfied with.

2. What went RIGHT?
We really learned how to cooperate, despite the very different working styles that we all have. We also learned the importance of flowcharts, and good time management. I think we really came together as a group.

3. Name 1 thing you could have done differently to help ensure you were ready to submit something solid by deadline.
Getting started sooner! Once we got going, it wasn't so bad, but we put it off more than we should have and as a result, the game wasn't as good as we had hoped it would be, by the original deadline

4. Based on this experience, what 1-3 things would you do differently when next you undertake an project of this nature?
1) Get organized and get started sooner
2) Plan out every step beforehand, every detail and every possible result!
